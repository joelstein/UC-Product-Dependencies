UC Product Dependencies
-----------------------

This module allows you to setup dependencies between two products, such that
one product cannot be added to the cart unless another cart has already been
added.

This is accomplished through CCK Node Reference fields. [finish explanation...]

Sample help text for your CCK Node Reference fields:

  If the ability to purchase this product depends on first purchasing another
  product, choose that product here. If you have multiple dependencies, then
  they will work in an "OR" fashion. Eg, this product may be purchased if
  either Product Dependency 1 or Product Dependency 2 has been purchased.
